# 🕵️‍♂️ Operation: Countdown (Down with the Count)
*Game Design & Architecture Document*

---

## 📌 High Concept

A high-stakes, comedic horror speed-dating detective visual novel built for GMTK Game Jam 2026 in Godot 4.

You play as an undercover detective investigating a 5-day "Radical Empathy Rehab" program at a high-security monster asylum. Among the candidates is **"The Count"** — a deadly Shapeshifter imposter. You must date candidates, build affection, spot species lore inconsistencies, and make your final accusation on Day 5 before the candidates are released!

## ⏳ Game Structure & Timers

* **Macro Loop (5 Days)**:
  * **Days 1–4**: 4 monster candidates randomly selected out of the 6 total designed pool. 1 candidate per day.
  * **Day 5**: Accusation & Dating Match Phase.
* **Micro Loop (3-Minute Speed Dates)**:
  * Strict 180-second real-time countdown timer per date.
  * Player balances asking interrogation questions vs. building romantic rapport ("rizz").

---

## 💖 Affection & Interrogation Mechanics

1. **Low Affection Penalty**:
   * If affection is too low, candidate becomes annoyed/cold and **refuses to answer interrogation questions** (locks clue options).
2. **High Affection Reward**:
   * Unlocks deep, vulnerable dialogue choices exposing personal details needed to test against species lore.
3. **Match Eligibility**:
   * On Day 5, you can only match/romance candidates if you have reached their required affection threshold.

## 🎭 Imposter Mechanics ("The Count") & Efficient Dialogue Design

* **Appearance**: The Count physically mirrors the copied monster 100%.
* **The Flaw**: The Count does not know species instincts, dietary habits, or biological lore (e.g. Zombie craving hot sunlight).
* **Dialogue Workflow**:
  * ~90% of a monster's dialogue lines are shared and identical whether they are real or The Count.
  * ~5 specific key dialogue branches check `if GameManager.is_imposter(candidate_id):` to swap in the subtle "lore slip" responses.

### Dialogue Example (`dialogue_manager` syntax):
```dialogue
~ food_interrogation
Detective: What's your comfort food after a stressful day?
if GameManager.is_imposter("zombie"):
	Zombie: Oh, a piping hot bowl of soup eaten on a sunny balcony!
	do GameManager.record_clue("zombie_sunlight_slip")
else:
	Zombie: Cold, decaying leftovers in a dark basement. Bright light makes my skin peel.
```

## 👹 Candidate Pool (Monster Species & IDs)

* Candidate IDs in code strictly use species names (e.g., `zombie`, `vampire`, `slime`, `angel`, `sea_monster`).

| Monster ID | Species | Personality / Disorder Trait | True Lore (Monsterpedia Rule) | Imposter Slip |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `zombie` | Zombie | Depression | Loves cold/rotting food; hates warmth & bright sun. | Enjoys hot food / basking in sunlight. |
| `vampire` | Vampire | Obsessive / Stalker | Snobbish about vintage blood types; strictly nocturnal. | Confuses blood flavor notes / likes early morning sun. |
| `slime` | Slime / Swamp | Social Anxiety | Craves damp/muddy spaces; stores items inside body. | Disgusted by mud / finds internal item storage weird. |
| `angel` | Biblical Angel | OCD | Obsessed with divine geometry, symmetry, & strict order. | Comfortable in messy or chaotic spaces. |
| `sea_monster` | Sea Monster | TBD | Deep knowledge of ocean depth pressure & saltwater. | Confuses ocean biology / prefers dry desert climates. |
| `monster_6` | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
